1. RULES 
=========

This game is inspired by the New York Time's Wordle.
The command line game differs slightly from the original web-based 
Wordle. The rules of the game are as follows:

The game starts by showing all the options allowed by the game. 
The user can choose to start a game or to review the rules by 
typing ".play" and ".info" respectively. The rest of the options

Like the orginal game, the aim is to guess a five letter word in 
6 tries. After each attempts, the game will show the letters that 
are correctly position. The following output tells us that the 
second letter is in the correct spot while all the other letters 
are not.

Enter a word: vague
  V1 V2 V3 V4 V5
1  w  e  a  r  y
2  p  i  l  l  s
3  v  a  g  u  e
Correct:  0 1 0 0 1
Present:  0 1 0 1 1
---

The second line is an indicator for whether the indexed letter is 
present in the secret word. The vector is equal to one when the
letter is present and zero, otherwise. If both vector are equal to
zero at the same index, this means that the letter is incorrect.

Enter a word: sauce
Congrats! You found the secret word 'sauce'

Once the player finds the correct word, the game ends and this 
output is shown. If the game is lost, the output will be similar
to what is shown next.

Better luck next time!

The game can be played every day for an unlimited amount of time.
The secret word is sample from a list of 2315 words

2. USE CASES
============

The game can be used to practice strategies for the actual NYT game.

3. ADD. NOTES
=============

This command line program is based on the famous Wordle game. 
I am unaware of any legal restriction on using the name "Wordle"
and the concept of the game for a personal project so I have 
decided to stick with this name. If, however, you believe that my 
small program infringues on your intellectual property, please 
contact me at contact[at]andreghonda[dot]com.

The secret word is defined as a global variable to allow for all
the functions to read & interact with the word. To avoid any 
spoilers, I advise to play the game in the R console in
full screen.
